## Activity 2: Code your Project @showdialog 
We need to connect our project to the computer to make it come to life with code!
The code will be the instructions that tell our micro:bit what to do. 

## Code Step 1 @showdialog
 Make sure your Climate Action Kit Breakout Board is turned on and your micro:bit is plugged into your computer. 
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/climate-action-kits/pxt-fwd-edu/main/tutorial-assets/pluganim.webp" width="400">


## Code Step 2 @showdialog
Click the three dots beside the  ``|Download|`` button, and click on _Connect Device_.
Next, follow the steps to pair your micro:bit.
![pair gif](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jessica-forwardedu/pxt-fwd-edu/main/tutorial-assets/DownloadButtonGIF.webp)

## Code  Step 3 
Next, click the ``|Download|`` button to download the code to your project. 

Note: You may want to prop your electric vehicle up on something so it doesn't drive away by accident while still plugged into the computer. 

## Activity 3: Modify your Project @showdialog  
We are now ready to modify our electric vehicle project. Follow the instructions at the top of the screen. 
When you're ready for more information, click *'Tell me more!'* <br>
After each change to the code, you will need to download the updated code to your project.

```template
input.onButtonPressed(Button.A, function () {
    IsDrivingEnabled = true
})
input.onButtonPressed(Button.B, function () {
    IsDrivingEnabled = false
})
let IsDrivingEnabled = false
fwdMotors.setupDriving(
fwdMotors.leftServo,
fwdMotors.rightServo,
-35
)
basic.forever(function () {
    if (IsDrivingEnabled) {
        if (fwdSensors.sonar1.fwdDistancePastThreshold(0.5, fwdSensors.ThresholdDirection.Under)) {
            fwdMotors.turn(15)
        } else {
            fwdMotors.drive(fwdMotors.DrivingDirection.Forward, 50)
        }
    } else {
        fwdMotors.stop()
    }
})

```
## Modify Step 1 
In this project, we use the sonar sensor to detect obstacles in the path of our electric vehicle. 
Take a look at the code in the workspace below. What do you think will happen when there's an obstacle? Make a prediction!

~hint  Tell me More!
- The sonar sensor works similarly to how bats find their way around. It sends out sound waves and checks how long they take to bounce back after hitting an object.
- Depending on what the sensor picks up, our electric vehicle can decide to keep going, slow down, or turn to avoid hitting something.
hint~

```blocks
basic.forever(function () {
    let IsDrivingEnabled = 0
    if (IsDrivingEnabled) {
        if (fwdSensors.sonar1.fwdDistancePastThreshold(0.5, fwdSensors.ThresholdDirection.Under)) {
            fwdMotors.turn(15)
        } else {
            fwdMotors.drive(fwdMotors.DrivingDirection.Forward, 50)
        }
    } else {
        fwdMotors.stop()
    }
})

```
  
## Modify Step 2 

The code below directs the electric car to ``||fwdMotors:turn 15 degrees in place||`` when it encounters an obstacle.

Can you identify the type of block we use to make this happen?

~hint Tell me More! 
- We are adding a decision-making point to the code. What kind of block allows us to do that?
hint~

## Modify Step 3 
In the code, the use of two conditional blocks helps the electric vehicle determine what to do when it encounters an obstacle. In this case, it will turn away from the object. <br>
Let’s test this out: unplug your electric vehicle from your computer, place it on the ground, and press the **A**  button to start driving! Press **B** once you are ready to stop the car.

~hint Tell me More!   
- A conditional is a block of code that triggers an action if certain conditions are met. 
- We use conditionals in real life, too. For example, “If it is raining, then I will take an umbrella.”
hint~

```block
if (IsDrivingEnabled) {
        if (fwdSensors.sonar1.fwdDistancePastThreshold(0.5, fwdSensors.ThresholdDirection.Under)) {
            fwdMotors.turn(10)
        } else {
            fwdMotors.drive(fwdMotors.DrivingDirection.Forward, 50)
        }
    } else {
        fwdMotors.stop()
    }
```

## Modify Step 4 
Within our second conditional, the block  ``||fwdSensors:sonar1 distance is under 0.5 m||``  tells our electric vehicle to trigger an event when something is within 0.5 meters of it.
What do you think will happen if we decrease this distance? 
Try it out—click on  ``||fwdSensors:sonar1 distance is under 0.5 m||``  and change it to  ``||fwdSensors:sonar1 distance is under  0.2m||``. 

~hint Tell me More!
- Plug your electric car back into your computer. 
- To apply your changes, click Download at the bottom of the page. 
- Then, unplug your project from the computer to test the new code.
hint~

```block
if (fwdSensors.sonar1.fwdDistancePastThreshold(0.5, fwdSensors.ThresholdDirection.Under)) {
            fwdMotors.turn(10)
        } else {
            fwdMotors.drive(fwdMotors.DrivingDirection.Forward, 50)
        }
```

## Modify Step 5 
Did you test your electric vehicle? Was your guess right? By lowering the threshold from 0.5 to 0.2 meters, your electric car now gets closer to objects before it turns and stops. This change has several benefits, including fewer false triggers from the sonar sensor!

~hint Tell me More! 
- A smaller distance setting can be good in environments where the vehicle might react to distant objects that aren’t directly in its path. 
- It will now ignore objects that are further than 0.2 meters away, focusing only on those that are immediately in front of it.
hint~

## Modify Step 6 
Now that you've seen how adjusting the sonar distance affects the electric vehicle's behavior, let’s experiment with it further. Adjust the  ``||fwdSensors:sonar1 distance is under  0.2m||`` block to different values like 0.1, 0.3, and 0.7 meters, and observe how the vehicle responds in various scenarios. <br>
What do you predict will happen with each change? How could the shape of an obstacle make a difference with the sonar?

~hint Tell me More! 
- Try testing your project in the same location after each adjustment to collect consistent data.
- Consider adding or removing obstacles for another round of testing to see how well the vehicle adapts to different environments.
- Don’t forget to click the Download button at the bottom of the page to update your code with each change.
hint~ 

## Modify Step 7 
Which one of those values gave your electric car the best result? Update your ``||fwdSensors:sonar1 distance is under 0 m||`` with the measurement that works best.


## Challenge Time! @showdialog
You might have noticed that with a shorter sonar distance, your electric vehicle ends up in tighter spots. Simply turning might not always be the best response. Let’s teach our electric car some new tricks for when it encounters obstacles.<br>
Think about what instructions we could add to the code to solve this problem. 

## Challenge Step 1 
Start by having the electric vehicle pause before making its next move. Click on ``||basic:Basic||``, drag the ``||Basic:pause 100||`` block, and place it just above the ``||fwdMotors:Turn 15° in place||`` in the second  ``||Logic:if else||`` block.  Change Pause 100  to Pause 1000. 



~hint Tell me More! 
- The "Pause 100" block delays the vehicle's next action for 1000 milliseconds or 1 second. 
- This short break allows you to better manage how the vehicle reacts to obstacles.
- Click Download at the bottom of the page to update the new code to your micro:bit.
hint~

```blocks
basic.forever(function () {
    let IsDrivingEnabled = 0
    if (IsDrivingEnabled) {
        if (fwdSensors.sonar1.fwdDistancePastThreshold(0.5, fwdSensors.ThresholdDirection.Under)) {
            basic.pause(1000)
            fwdMotors.turn(15)
        } else {
            fwdMotors.drive(fwdMotors.DrivingDirection.Forward, 50)
        }
    } else {
        fwdMotors.stop()
    }
})
```

## Challenge Step 2 
Did you test the new code? Now, let's enhance this by adding a second pause block to bracket our ``||fwdMotors:turn 15° in place||`` action.

Click on ``||basic:Basic||`` , drag another ``||basic:pause 100||``, and place it just below the ``||fwdMotors:turn 15° in place||`` within the second  ``||Logic:if else||`` block.  Change ``||basic:pause 100||``  to ``||basic:pause 1000||`` 


~hint Tell me More! 
- Adding a pause both before and after the turn action can help simulate a more realistic driving scenario.
- It gives the vehicle a moment to 'decide' its next move, much like a driver would at a crossroads. 
- This setup not only makes the vehicle's movements more deliberate but also easier to observe and adjust during testing.
hint~

```blocks
basic.forever(function () {
    let IsDrivingEnabled = 0
    if (IsDrivingEnabled) {
        if (fwdSensors.sonar1.fwdDistancePastThreshold(0.5, fwdSensors.ThresholdDirection.Under)) {
            basic.pause(1000)
            fwdMotors.turn(15)
            basic.pause(1000)
        } else {
            fwdMotors.drive(fwdMotors.DrivingDirection.Forward, 50)
        }
    } else {
        fwdMotors.stop()
    }
})
```

## Challenge Step 3  
Now that we have added another ``||basic:pause 100||`` block, we need to help the electric car get out of tight situations.
 Click on  ``||fwdMotors:Motors||`` drag and drop ``||fwdMotors:Drive Forward at 50||`` under the second ``||basic:pause 1000||`` block. Using the dropdown arrow, change ``||fwdMotors:Forward||`` to ``||fwdMotors:Reverse||``. Change ``||fwdMotors:Reverse 50||`` to ``||fwdMotors:Reverse 100||`` <br> Then download the new code to test it.

~hint Tell me More! 
- By adding this reverse block, we are enabling the electric car to back away from obstacles, providing it with a better strategy to avoid getting stuck.
- Don’t see the change in your code? Don’t forget to download the updated code by plugging in your micro:bit.
- Remember just in case leave the breakout off when connected to your computer.
hint~

```blocks
basic.forever(function () {
    let IsDrivingEnabled = 0
    if (IsDrivingEnabled) {
        if (fwdSensors.sonar1.fwdDistancePastThreshold(0.5, fwdSensors.ThresholdDirection.Under)) {
            basic.pause(1000)
            fwdMotors.turn(15)
            basic.pause(1000)
            fwdMotors.drive(fwdMotors.DrivingDirection.Reverse, 50)
        } else {
            fwdMotors.drive(fwdMotors.DrivingDirection.Forward, 50)
        }
    } else {
        fwdMotors.stop()
    }
})
```

## Challenge Step 4 
What did you think of the updated code? Now, the electric car follows a more complex series of actions when it encounters an obstacle. For an extra challenge, click on ``||fwdMotors:Motors||`` and drag the ``||fwdMotors:stop motors||`` block into the workspace. 
Where do you think it would be best to place it?

~hint Tell me More!
- Place 'stop all motors' as the first action in the sequence.
- By positioning the 'stop all motors' block at the start, we ensure that the electric car halts immediately, allowing any obstacles to clear from its path. 
- This is an excellent safety feature, similar to emergency stop systems used in real-world vehicles.
hint~

```blocks
basic.forever(function () {
    let IsDrivingEnabled = 0
    if (IsDrivingEnabled) {
        if (fwdSensors.sonar1.fwdDistancePastThreshold(0.5, fwdSensors.ThresholdDirection.Under)) {
            fwdMotors.stop()
            basic.pause(1000)
            fwdMotors.turn(15)
            basic.pause(1000)
            fwdMotors.drive(fwdMotors.DrivingDirection.Reverse, 50)
        } else {
            fwdMotors.drive(fwdMotors.DrivingDirection.Forward, 50)
        }
    } else {
        fwdMotors.stop()
    }
})
```
