## Activity 1: Building Your Project @showdialog
Welcome to Powering the Future with Wind Energy Level 1. For this project, we will use the Dial to trigger different symbols to show on the micro:bit LEDs. Here's what it will look like.

## Activity 2:Coding Set up @showdialog
## Step 1 @showdialog
IMPORTANT! Make sure your Climate Action Kit Breakout Board is turned on and your micro:bit is plugged into your computer.

## Step 2 @showhint
Click three dots besides ``|Download|`` button, and click on _Connect Device_.
Next, follow the steps to pair your micro:bit.

## Step 3 
Next, click the ``|Download|`` button to download the blank project to start-up the simulators. 

## Step 4 @showdialog 
This is how the simulators should look after a successful download. You can see the Dial, and the Servo Motors alongside the Pump.

## Step 5 @showhint
Look below the @boardname@ simulator to see the Climate Action kit Breakout Board and the connected sensors.
Try turning the Dial on your project, the virtual  simulator will react to it.
