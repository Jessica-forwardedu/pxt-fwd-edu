## Activity 1 Building your Protoype @showdialog 
Welcome to the Level 2 Wind Turbine Project!

## Actitity 2 Coding your Prototype @showdialog 
Welcome to the coding section!

```template 
fwdSensors.touch.fwdOnTouch(jacdac.ButtonEvent.Down, function () {
	})
fwdSensors.dial1.fwdOnDialTurned(fwdSensors.DialDirection.CCW, function (difference) {
	})
fwdSensors.dial1.fwdOnDialTurned(fwdSensors.DialDirection.CW, function (difference) {
	})
```
## Step 1 @showdialog 
IMPORTANT! Make sure your Climate Action Kit Breakout Board is turned on and your micro:bit is plugged into your computer. 

## Step 2 @showdialog 
Start coding! Follow the steps at the top of the screen for your instructions. Click the lightbulb icon for a hint if you get stuck. 

## Step 3 
Click the three dots beside [Download] button, and click on Connect Device. Next, follow the steps to pair your micro:bit. 

## Step 4 
Next, click the [Download] button to download the blank project to start-up the simulators. 

## Step 5 
This is how the simulators should look after a successful pairing and download. 

## Step 6 
Look below the virtual micro:bit on the left to see the virtual robotic components - these are our simulators! Try turning the Dial on your project in real-life. The virtual simulator Dial will react to it! 

## Step 7 
Try clicking the on/off button on the virtual simulator for the first Servo Motor (labelled Left). What happens? Can you use the slider to change the speed? 

## Time to start Coding 

## Step 8 
Look at our coding workspace below. We have three sets of code blocks. What do you notice is different about each of the [on dial1 turned difference] blocks?
~hint Click here 
- One block is for clockwise direction
- One block is for counterclockwise 
- One is for pushing down on the dial
hint~

## Step 9 
These ``||fwdSensors:on dial1 turned difference||`` blocks are called Inputs. They wait for a specific action, in our case, a Dial turned. Once triggered, the code that's inside will take place.

## Step 10 
Let's add an action inside of our input blocks. Click on the ``||fwdMotors:Motors||`` drawers and find the 'Servo (Continuous)' section. Drag a ``||fwdMotors:set leftServo to 50 %||`` block onto the workspace.

```blocks 
fwdMotors.leftServo.fwdSetSpeed(50) 
``` 
## Step 11 
Place the ``||fwdMotors:set leftServo to 50 %||`` block inside of the first ``||fwdSensors:on dial1 turned difference||`` block. 

```blocks
fwdSensors.touch.fwdOnTouch(jacdac.ButtonEvent.Down, function () {
	
})
fwdSensors.dial1.fwdOnDialTurned(fwdSensors.DialDirection.CCW, function (difference) {
    fwdMotors.leftServo.fwdSetSpeed(50)
})
fwdSensors.dial1.fwdOnDialTurned(fwdSensors.DialDirection.CW, function (difference) {
	
})
```
