## Activity 1 @showdialog 
Welcome to the Monitoring Bees and pollination with a bug counter. 

## Step 1 
For this project, we will use the Touch Sensor to detect when a 'bee' has landed on our prototype.  The LED light will turn on when a 'bee' visits the prototype.

IMPORTANT! Make sure your Climate Action Kit Breakout Board is turned on and your micro:bit is plugged into your computer. 

## Activity 2 Setting up Coding @showdialog 

Start coding! Follow the steps at the top of the screen for your instructions. Click the lightbulb icon for a hint if you get stuck. 

## Step 1 
Click the three dots beside [Download] button, and click on Connect Device. Next, follow the steps to pair your micro:bit. 

## Step 2 
Next, click the [Download] button to download the blank project to start-up the simulators. 

## Step 3 
This is how the simulators should look after a successful pairing and download. 

## Step 4 
Look below the virtual micro:bit on the left to see the virtual robotic components - these are our simulators! Try touching the Touch Sensor on your project in real-life. The virtual simulator Touch Sensor will react to it! 

## Step 5 
Try clicking the lights on the virtual simulator for the LED Light. What happens? Can you make it different colours?
