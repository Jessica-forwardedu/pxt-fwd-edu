## Activity 1 Coding your Project

## Introduction @showdialog 
Welcome to Powering the Future with Wind Energy Level 1!

## Welcome @showdialog
In the first activity, we're going to make a simple prototype using the basic parts from the big Wind Turbine project.

## Step 1 @showdialog
IMPORTANT! Make sure your Climate Action Kit Breakout Board is turned on and your micro:bit is plugged into your computer.

## Step 2 @showhint
Click three dots besides ``|Download|`` button, and click on _Connect Device_.
Next, follow the steps to pair your micro:bit.

## Step 3 @showhint
Start coding! Follow the steps at the top of the screen for your instructions. Click the lightbulb icon for a hint if you get stuck. 

## Step 4 @showdialog
Click the three dots beside [Download] button, and click on Connect Device. Next, follow the steps to pair your micro:bit. 

## Step 5 @showdialog 
Next, click the [Download] button to download the blank project to start-up the simulators. 

## Step 6 @showdialog 
This is how the simulators should look after a successful download. You can see the Dial, and the Servo Motors along side the Pump.

## Step 7 @showhint
Look below the @boardname@ simulator to see the Climate Action kit Breakout Board and the connected sensors.
Try turning the Dial on your project, the virtual  simulator will react to it.

## Step 8 
Look at our coding workshop below. We have three sets of code blocks here. What do you notice is different about each of the ``||fwdSensors:on dial1 turned difference||`` blocks?  

```template
fwdSensors.touch.fwdOnTouch(jacdac.ButtonEvent.Down, function () {
    basic.showIcon(IconNames.No)
})
fwdSensors.dial1.fwdOnDialTurned(fwdSensors.DialDirection.CCW, function (difference) {
    basic.showIcon(IconNames.SmallSquare)
})
fwdSensors.dial1.fwdOnDialTurned(fwdSensors.DialDirection.CW, function (difference) {
    basic.showIcon(IconNames.Diamond)
})
```

## Step 9 
Try changing the icons in the ``||basic:show icon||`` blocks for yourself! Click the dropdown arrow, and choose any pattern. Click the drop down arrow and choose any pattern. 
~hint 
- Make sure you choose a different for each one.

## Step 10 
Click the [Download] button to download the code to your project. 

## Step 11 
Try testing your project in real-life! This is what it should look like. 

## Step 12 @showdialog 
Congratulations on finishing your coding project! 

##Step 13 @showdialog 
In the next step, you can click the [Done] button to finish the tutorial.
