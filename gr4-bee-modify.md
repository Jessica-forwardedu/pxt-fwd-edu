## Activity 2: Code your Project @showdialog
We need to connect our project to the computer to make it come to life with code! The code will be the instructions that tell our micro:bit what to do.

```template
let bugVisits = 0
bugVisits = 0
basic.showNumber(bugVisits)
basic.forever(function () {
    if (fwdSensors.touch.fwdIsPressed()) {
        bugVisits += 1
        basic.showNumber(bugVisits)
    }
})

```
## Code Step 1 @showdialog
 Make sure your Climate Action Kit Breakout Board is turned on and your micro:bit is plugged into your computer.

## Code Step 2 @showdialog
Click three dots beside the ``|Download|`` button, and click on _Connect Device_. Next, follow the steps to pair your micro:bit.
![pair gif](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jessica-forwardedu/pxt-fwd-edu/main/tutorial-assets/DownloadButtonGIF.webp)

## Code Step 3 
Next, click the ``|Download|`` button to download code to your project.

## Activity 3: Modify your Project @showdialog 
We are ready to modify our Bee Counter!

Follow the instructions at the top of the screen. When you are ready for more information, click **'Tell me more!'**
After each change, you will need to ``|Download|`` your updated code to your project.

## Modify Step 1 
In this project, we are tracking the number of bees that visit our flower - like a scientist!
We are going to use something called a ``||Variables:Variables||`` to track this number. In this program, our variable is named 'bugVisits'.

~hint Tell me More!
- In coding, we can store information using **Variables** 
- Think of a variable like your piggy bank.
- Money can go in and out, but you have to open it up to see the amount inside!
  hint~

## Modify Step 2 
Let's look at variables in action.


What number do you see on the micro:bit right now?
What do you think this number means?

~hint Tell me More!
    - The number we see on the micro:bit  is '0'. 
    - It is the number of bees that have visited our flower so far. 
    - We set this number to '0' by putting the set bugVisits to 0
      block inside the On Start event.
hint~

```blocks
let bugVisits = 0
bugVisits = 0 
```

## Modify Step 3 
Try changing the number inside the ``||variables:set bugVisits to 0||`` block to something between 1 and 5. What happens? 

~hint Tell me More! 
- The number we see on the Mirco:bit changes too.
- Don't see the change? Remember to download the new code. 
 hint~

## Modify Step 4 
Let's press the touch sensor a couple of times. 


What do you see? 

~hint Tell me More!
- Our touch is like a bee landing on the sensor.
- Each time you press the touch sensor, the number shown on the micro:bit goes up by 1.
- This means our variable is changing by 1.
- We use a **conditional statements** in our code to make this work. 
hint~

```blocks
let bugVisits = 0
bugVisits = 0
basic.showNumber(bugVisits)
basic.forever(function () {
    if (fwdSensors.touch.fwdIsPressed()) {
        bugVisits += 3
        basic.showNumber(bugVisits)
    }
})

```

## Modify Step 5 
**Conditional statements** tell our micro:bit what to do when some condition is met. <br> We use conditional statements in our own lives. For example, "If the bell rings at recess, then I line up to go inside!" <br> Can you find the conditional statement in our code?

```blocks
let bugVisits = 0
basic.forever(function () {
    if (fwdSensors.touch.fwdIsPressed()) {
        bugVisits += 1
        basic.showNumber(bugVisits)
    }
})
```

## Modify Step 6 

What happens when you increase the number in ``||Variables:change bugVisits by 1||``?  <br> Try changing it to '3' now, ``|download|`` the new code.  Then press the touch sensor.

~hint Tell me More 
- Now each time you press the touch sensor, the number on the micro:bit goes up by 3.
- This block changes the number in out variable.
- Remember the piggy bank? It's like when we add money to it!
  hint~

```blocks
let bugVisits = 0
bugVisits = 0
basic.showNumber(bugVisits)
basic.forever(function () {
    if (fwdSensors.touch.fwdIsPressed()) {
        bugVisits += 3
        basic.showNumber(bugVisits)
    }
})

```

## Modify Step 6 

Now that you've got the hang of how variables work, let's adjust the number in ``||Variables:change bugVisits by 3||`` back to 1 and ``||Variables:set bugVisits by 3||`` to 0 again.

~hint Tell me More!
- We're counting each bee visit as just one. Simple, right?
- Keeping the number at 3 would mix up our count! It's like counting every single bee as 3.
-  Let’s keep things accurate by changing it back to 1.
hint~

```blocks
let bugVisits = 0
bugVisits = 0
basic.showNumber(bugVisits)
basic.forever(function () {
    if (fwdSensors.touch.fwdIsPressed()) {
        bugVisits += 3
        basic.showNumber(bugVisits)
    }
})
```




## Activity 4: Challenge @showdialog 
Let's try and use the LED lights! Can you make the LED lights turn on each time a bee lands? 

## Challenge Step 1 
First, we need to control the LED lights. Go to ``||fwdSensors:Sensors||`` and drag  and drop ``||fwdSensors:set all ledRing LEDs to||`` block into the workspace.

~hint Tell me More 
- Just like a painter picks the right brush for a stroke, we need the right block to control our LED lights.
- This block is like the switch it tells all the LEDs what to do at once
hint~

```blocks
let bugVisits = 0
bugVisits = 0
basic.showNumber(bugVisits)
basic.forever(function () {
    if (fwdSensors.touch.fwdIsPressed()) {
        bugVisits += 0
        basic.showNumber(bugVisits)
    }
})
```

## Challenge Step 2 

Now, think about when you want these lights to turn on. After a bee lands, right? <br>Where should we put this block to make that happen?<br> Can you make the light turn green?<br> Use the lightbulb icon to check your work! 

~hint Tell me More!
- Remember, the order in which we place our blocks is very important, just like the steps in a dance routine!
hint~

```blocks
let bugVisits = 0
bugVisits = 0
basic.showNumber(bugVisits)
basic.forever(function () {
    if (fwdSensors.touch.fwdIsPressed()) {
        bugVisits += 1
        fwdSensors.ledRing.fwdSetAllPixelsColour(0x00ff00)
        basic.showNumber(bugVisits)
    }
})
```
## Challenge Step 3 

Got it in place? Awesome! This block should go right after we count a bee visit, under the ``||variables:change beeVisits to 1||`` block. Remember, our code runs in the order we place the blocks.

~hint Tell me More!
- Don't forget to test your changed code by downloading the new code!
- Check your work against the light blub. 
  hint~

  ```blocks
  let bugVisits = 0
  bugVisits = 0
basic.showNumber(bugVisits)
basic.forever(function () {
    if (fwdSensors.touch.fwdIsPressed()) {
        bugVisits += 1
        fwdSensors.ledRing.fwdSetAllPixelsColour(0x00ff00)
        basic.showNumber(bugVisits)
    }
})
```

## Challenge Step 4

We’ve got green for go—when bees visit. How about red for when our garden is calm, with no bees around? Let’s grab another ``||fwdSensors:set all ledRing LEDs to||`` block from ``||fwdSensors:Sensors||``. Think about the best spot to place this block.

~hint Tell me More!
- If we want the lights to be a different colour BEFORE a bug visist it needs to be the first thing our code does
- Don't forget to download your changed code onto the mirco:bit
hint~

  ```blocks
  let bugVisits = 0
bugVisits = 0
basic.showNumber(bugVisits)
basic.forever(function () {
    if (fwdSensors.touch.fwdIsPressed()) {
        bugVisits += 1
        fwdSensors.ledRing.fwdSetAllPixelsColour(0x00ff00)
        basic.showNumber(bugVisits)
    }
})
```

## Challenge Step 5 
Did you place it correctly? The ``||fwdSensors:set all ledRing LEDs to||`` block should be placed within the ``||basic:on start||`` block, above the ``||variables:set beeVisits to 0||``. <br> Use the lightbulb icon to check your code!

```blocks
fwdSensors.ledRing.fwdSetAllPixelsColour(0xff0000)
let bugVisits = 0
bugVisits = 0
basic.showNumber(bugVisits)
basic.forever(function () {
    if (fwdSensors.touch.fwdIsPressed()) {
        bugVisits += 1
        fwdSensors.ledRing.fwdSetAllPixelsColour(0x00ff00)
        basic.showNumber(bugVisits)
    }
})
```
