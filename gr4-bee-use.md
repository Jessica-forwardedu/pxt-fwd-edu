## Activity 1: Build your Project @showdialog 

Let's build a Bee Counter! 
We are going to do this in three parts: 
1. Build your Bee Counter 
2. Add code to make it work
3. Play with the Bee Counter to learn how it works

## Activity 2: Code your Project 
We need to connect our project to the computer to make it come to life with code! The code will be the instructions that tell our micro: bit what to do.

## Code Step 1 @showdialog 
Make sure your Climate Action Kit Breakout Board is turned on and your micro:bit is plugged into your computer.

## Code Step 2 @showdialog

Click the three dots beside ``|Download|`` button, and click on Connect Device. Next, follow the steps to pair your micro:bit.

## Code Step 3 
Next ``|Download|`` button to download the code to your Project and to see the smart component simulators. 

## Activity 3: Use your Project @showdialog 

We are ready to use our Bee Counter. Follow the instructions at the top of the screen. When you are ready for more information click 'Tell me more!'
