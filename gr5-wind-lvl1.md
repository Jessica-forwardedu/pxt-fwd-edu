[# Powering The Future with Wind Energy Unit 1

## Activity 1: Building Your Project @showdialog
Welcome to the Level 1 Wind Turbine Power Storage Project! For this project, we will use the Dial to trigger the Motor on the Wind Turbine. The Wind Turbine will turn in the same direction as the Dial is being turned and will change speeds based on the Dial's position. We will use the LED Light to tell us whether the Wind Turbine is moving clockwise or counterclockwise, depending on the Dial's position.
